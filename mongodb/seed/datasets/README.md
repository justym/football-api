## How to Use the Public JSON API Service - No API Key Required ;-)

Use the "raw" links served by GitHub (
otherwise you get the complete "formatted" GitHub page). Example:

```
$ curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openfootball/football.json/master/2015-16/en.1.clubs.json
```


## Updates / Contributions Welcome - Please Update the Source Text Files

Note: The JSON files get (auto-)generated using the football.db datasets, thus, **please do NOT
edit the (auto-) generated JSON files but the source text files in the country repos** e.g.:

- English Premier League in [`/england`](https://github.com/openfootball/england)
- Deutsche Bundesliga in [`/deutschland`](https://github.com/openfootball/deutschland)
- Spanish Primera Divisi√≥n ("La Liga") in [`/espana`](https://github.com/openfootball/espana)
- Italian Serie A  in [`/italy`](https://github.com/openfootball/italy)
- and so on

and than (auto-)generate the football.json updates. If you only edit / patch the (auto-)generated JSON files without updating 
the sources than your changes will get lost / overwritten with the next update.


## Do-It-Yourself (DIY) - How To (Auto)-Generate and Update the football.json Datasets

If you want to help out updating the (auto-)generated football.json datasets right here from the sources - you are more than welcome. See the [`yorobot/football.json`](https://github.com/yorobot/football.json) build scripts for a start 
or use your very own.

## Automate, Automate, Automate

If all works weekly updates get pushed by yorobot.
